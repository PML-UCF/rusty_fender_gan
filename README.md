# Python Implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks for Extrapolation of Corrosion in Automobile Images

This repository is provided as a tutorial for the rust level and texture maps prediction and application to cars' fender.  

The repository consists of the following four folders:

### ds:
- train contains the training set used for the Rust Level Network (RLN) and Rust Texture Network (RTN) training
- test contains the images that were lately acquired for a comparison with the models' predicted maps

### target-cars:
- img contains car images.
- mask contains the masks for each car image.
- annotation holds three points along the fender of each car (the start of the fender, its end, and an arbitrary point in between) and the estimated radius in pixels.

### samples:
- maps contains examples of maps generated by our RLN and RTN models.
- cars contains the results of the generated maps applied to the target cars.

### src:
- utils is a set of functions used for the rust map application.
- main is a back-to-back pipeline for our application, from the RLN and RTN predictions until the rust maps application in a car.

Once our manuscript is accept, the code will be updated with the latest models implementation.
